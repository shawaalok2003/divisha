                                At StartXV, we provide online services and do not deal in physical products. Therefore, we do not offer any shipping
                                or exchange policies. We understand that some payment aggregators may require a shipping and exchange policy, but as
                                we do not have any physical products to ship or exchange, we cannot provide such a policy.
